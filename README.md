The program runs through the subfolders of a directory and reduces all images of filetype png, jpeg and jpg 
to a reduced dimension in order to save disk space when uploading to the web. The file width to height ratio
remains unaffected.

Maximum dimension is set to 800 pixels and can be changed by the variable.

TODO: Prompt for possible maximum dimensions, e.g. 800, 500, 400, 250
